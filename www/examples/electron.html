<h2>Example Electron Content-Security-Policy warning</h2>
<p>If you don't set a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> in your electron app, You might see a message like this in the developer tools console:</p>
<blockquote>
	<strong>Electron Security Warning (Insecure Content-Security-Policy)</strong>
	<br>
	This renderer process has either no Content Security
	    Policy set or a policy with "unsafe-eval" enabled. This exposes users of
	    this app to unnecessary security risks.
	<br>
	For more information and help, consult
	https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security.
	This warning will not show up
	once the app is packaged.
</blockquote>
<p>The Electron Security Warning was added in Electron 6.</p>
<h2>Adding a Content-Security-Policy to Electron Apps</h2>
<p>Probably one of the easier ways to do this is to use the <a href="/examples/meta/" title="CSP in Meta Tag">HTML Meta Tag to add a Content Security Policy</a>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'"&gt;</pre>
<h2>Removing <code>unsafe-eval</code></h2>
<p>If your Electron App does have a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> set, but has to use <code>unsafe-eval</code>, then take a look through your JavaScript code for calls to the <code>eval()</code> function and see if they can be removed. If the eval call is in third party libraries, see if you can update it. Sometimes older versions of libraries have a call to eval, and newer versions have been fixed to avoid it.</p>
