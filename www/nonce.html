	<h1>Using a <code>nonce</code> with CSP</h1>
	<div class="lead">A <code>nonce</code> is a randomly generated token that should be used only one time. </div>
</div>
<h2>What is a nonce?</h2>
<p>The word <dfn><code>nonce</code></dfn> can be defined as a word or phrase that is intended for use only once. If you were a spy, you might come up with a nonce as a code word to authenticate a rendezvous.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember for nonces with respect to (<abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr>) is that we only use our nonce once (for one request), and they should be so random that no one could guess it.</p> 
<h2>Example Nonce Usage</h2>
<p>Using a <code>nonce</code> is one of the easiest ways to allow the execution of inline scripts in a Content Security Policy (CSP). Here's how one might use it with the CSP <a href="/script-src/"><code>script-src</code></a> directive:</p>
<pre>
script-src 'nonce-r@nd0m';
</pre>
<blockquote>
	<strong>NOTE:</strong> We are using the phrase: <em>r@nd0m</em> to denote a random value. You should use a cryptographically secure random token generator to generate a nonce value. The random nonce value should only be used for a single HTTP request.
</blockquote>
<p>Now we can allow an inline <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to execute by adding our random nonce value in the <code>nonce</code> attribute of the <code>script</code> tag:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script nonce="r@nd0m"&gt;
	doWhatever();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h2>What is a CSP nonce for?</h2>
<p>So why do we need a to add a csp nonce to every inline script block when we use CSP? The short answer is that when you enable CSP it will disable inline script tags, so code like the following will not execute:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script&gt;
	thisWillNotExecute();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>This is because the browser doesn't know the difference between JavaScript code that you wrote and 
intend for the user to execute vs code that an attacker has injected into the page (for example via an XSS vulnerability). 
These inline script blocks are dangerous, and the nonce lets the browser know that the server intended on serving this script block if and only if
the nonce attribute in the script tag matches the nonce value in the <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header.</p>
<h2>Avoid this common nonce mistake</h2>
<p>If you are outputting variables inside a nonce protected <code>script</code> tag, you could cancel out the XSS protection that CSP is giving you.</p>
<p>For example assume you have a URL such as <code>/example/?id=123</code> and you are outputting that <code>id</code> value from the URL in your script block:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script nonce="#request.nonce#"&gt;
	var id = #url.id#
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>In the above example assume that the variable token <code>#url.id#</code> is the <code>id</code> value from the query string. Now an attacker could request the URL: <code>/example/?id=doSomethingBad()</code>, and your application would send back:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script nonce="r@nd0m"&gt;
	var id = doSomethingBad()
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>As you can see we just threw away all the protections of CSP, here's a rule for avoiding this:</p>
<blockquote>
	<strong>The CSP nonce rule</strong>
	<p>Only use <code>nonce</code> on <code>script</code> tags that do not contain any untrusted variables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do need to use a variable like in the above example, you need to make sure that it has been validated. In this case we could make sure it is a valid integer. In more complex cases you would need pass the variable through an encoder that would escape javascript. For example in the Java OWASP ESAPI library the <code>encodeJavaScript</code> function could be used, or in CFML the <code>encodeForJavaScript</code> function could be used. </p>

<h2>What if a CSP nonce doesn't make sense?</h2>
<p>In some situations using a nonce doesn't make sense, in those cases you can use a <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/hash/">CSP hash</a> instead of a nonce.</p>
<p>There is one other workaround to this problem called <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/unsafe-inline/">unsafe-inline</a>, but as its name suggests it is not really a good idea to use it (except in specific conditions).</p>
<h2>Nonce Browser Support</h2>
<p>The <code>nonce</code> source list directive was added to CSP Level 2. This means that support has existed since 2015 in Chrome and Firefox, Safari 10+ or Edge 15+.</p>
<p>Nonces are not supported at all in Internet Explorer, you need to use the Edge browser for nonce support instead.</p>
