<h2>What is a nonce?</h2>
<p>The word <dfn><code>nonce</code></dfn> can be defined as a word or phrase that is intended for use only once. If you were a spy, you might come up with a nonce as a code word to authenticate a rendezvous.</p>
<p>The important things to remember for nonces with respect to (<abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr>) is that we only use our nonce once (for one request), and they should be so random that no one could guess it.</p> 
<h2>Example Nonce Usage</h2>
<p>Using a <code>nonce</code> is one of the easiest ways to allow the execution of inline scripts in a Content Security Policy (CSP). Here's how one might use it with the CSP <a href="/script-src/"><code>script-src</code></a> directive:</p>
<pre>
script-src 'nonce-r@nd0m';
</pre>
<blockquote>
	<strong>NOTE:</strong> We are using the phrase: <em>r@nd0m</em> to denote a random value. You should use a cryptographically secure random token generator to generate a nonce value. The random nonce value should only be used for a single HTTP request.
</blockquote>
<p>Now we can allow an inline <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to execute by adding our random nonce value in the <code>nonce</code> attribute of the <code>script</code> tag:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script nonce="r@nd0m"&gt;
	doWhatever();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Nonce Browser Support</h2>
<p>The <code>nonce</code> source list directive was added to CSP Level 2. This means that support has existed since 2015 in Chrome and Firefox, Safari 10+ or Edge 15+.</p>
<p>Nonces are not supported at all in Internet Explorer, you need to use the Edge browser for nonce support instead.</p>
